    "\n",
    "This first section of the cookbook aims at providing the reader with an introduction to [**H**ierarchical **E**qual **A**rea iso**L**atitude **Pix**elation (HEALPix)](https://healpix.sourceforge.io/). However, rather than duplicating tons of information that is already available at HEALPix resources, we will try guiding the Pythia's community in the right direction to access those resources.\n",

    "HEALPix is a high resolution discretization framework to provide equal area, iso-Latitude pixelation of a sphere for fast analysis of data distributed on it, which produces a subdivision of the spherical surface in which each pixel covers the same surface area as every other pixel at a given resolution level. \n",
    "\n",
    "HEALPix was originally devised to support fast and accurate mathematical calculations on a spherical discretization at sufficiently high resolution levels for satellite missions to measure the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and it has later been adopted to geoscience applications as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be sure to check out the [HEALPix home page](https://healpix.sourceforge.io/index.php) and the References at the end of this section for further details.\n",

    "Three key features of HEALPix are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The sphere is hierarchically tessellated into curvilinear quadrilaterals\n",
    "* Areas of all pixels at a given resolution are identical\n",
    "* Pixels are distributed on lines of constant latitude\n",
    "\n",
    "These properties make HEALPix a good gridding choice to facilitate fast and accurate statistical and spherical analysis for high-resolution data such as spherical harmonics."
