# Land-Atmosphere Interaction (hk25-Land)

The land-atmosphere interaction is one of the key drivers of Earth's surface water and energy budgets. Among these, soil moisture plays a crucial role by regulating surface heat fluxes, which in turn influence boundary layer development and precipitation. These processes are fundamental to understanding convection, climate feedbacks, and extreme events such as droughts, heatwaves, and floods.
Unlike coarse-resolution global circulation models or regional km-scale models, global km-scale models can explicitly resolve convection and eliminate the need for prescribed large-scale circulation. This enables a more holistic and physically consistent representation of land-atmosphere processes.

In this team, we aim to identify global hotspots of land-atmosphere coupling and evaluate the added value of high-resolution global simulations in capturing the influence of soil moisture on extreme events. Specifically, we will assess how changes in soil moisture affect precipitation, heatwaves, and droughts through their impacts on surface heat fluxes and boundary layer dynamics.

Sketch of initial activities:
+ Identify global hotspots of land-atmosphere coupling using km-scale model output
+ Quantify soil moisture-precipitation feedback across different regions
+ Analyze where and how spatial variability is introduced in km-scale models compared to coarser-resolution models
