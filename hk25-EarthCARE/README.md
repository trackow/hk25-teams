# Joint EarthCARE analysis (hk25-EarthCare)

[EarthCARE](https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/missions/earthcare) --- **Earth** *C*loud, *A*erosol and *R*adiation *E*xplorer --- — is a joint satellite mission by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). It is the sixth mission selected under ESA’s Earth Explorer Programme and was launched on 28 May 2024. By the time of the Hackathon, it will be approaching its first full year in orbit. EarthCARE offers a unique combination of four active and passive instruments for observing clouds, aerosols, and radiation.

In this team we will analyze both EarthCARE data and the participating models along virtual EarthCARE swaths, with an initial focus on tropical deep convection as analyzed by EarthCARE, aircraft, ships and ground stations during the [ORCESTRA campaign](http://orcestra-campaign.org/), i.e., over the Tropical Atlantic in the time-period between 10 August and 30 September, 2024. In addition, we are interested in extending this analysis framework to other phenomena such as tropical cyclones and subtropical stratocumulus, to evaluate how these systems are represented in both models and EarthCARE data. 

**Note**:   We actively invite collaboration with science teams whose research aligns with EarthCARE’s mission and our initial objectives, and look forward to jointly integrating observational and modeling approaches.

**Coordination**: Saskia Brose (saskia.brose@esa.int)

#### Sketch of initial activities:
* extract model output along selected orbit frames
* post-process output using model simulators
* extract analagous EarthCARE frames and data from reanalyses
* perform composit analysis of various quantities
* applied research interests: tropical convection/ORCESTRA campaign, tropical cyclones, and stratocumulus clouds
