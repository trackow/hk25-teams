In this folder are the connectivity files corresponding to HealPix grids for TempestExtremes. 
Only zooms 0 to 2 are provided via GitHub as the files otherwise get too big for GitHub. 
If you want files for zoom levels 3 to 10, you have three options: 
1. Find them on my JASMIN space with path: /home/users/sbourdin/WCRP_Hackathon/hk25-teams/hk25-TropCyc/ConnectivityFiles/
2. Find them on Google Drive with path: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fNDDQA_G-yy05SP8J8pV2EIFJCs1bOtb?usp=sharing
3. Re-produce them with the scripts in hk25-TropCyc/notebooks/1_Get_Connectivity_Files
