# Inter-Scale Energy Transfers in the Atmosphere (hk25-InterScale)

Many atmospheric phenomena, especially in the tropics, are scale-coupled. Small-scale convection (scales much less than 100 km) tends to aggregate into meso-scales (100-500 km), and both of these smaller-scale processes feed upscale onto much larger phenomena - e.g. MCSs, Tropical Cyclones, Equatorial Waves and the MJO. The reverse is also true through downscale energy transer, and is more well convered in the literature. This team aims to explore the inter-scale energetics of the atmosphere using the [LoSSETT](https://github.com/ElliotMG/LoSSETT) tool to extract the $\mathcal{D}_\ell$ term (see LoSSETT README), and make progress toward the following with similarly interested collaborators:

#### Outline of planned activities
* Run LoSSETT on the global year-long simulations to extract a climatology of $\mathcal{D}_\ell$
* Explore the inter-scale energetic structure of select atmospheric phenomena
* Understand the transfer of energy near the grid-scale of these km-scale simulations
* Examine values of the same $\mathcal{D}_\ell$ at different HEALPix levels to ensure energy conservation away from filter scale

**Note:** As a cross-cutting team we welcome collaboration with other science teams where there is interest in understanding inter-scale energy transfers in atmospheric phenomena. The upscale impact of small-scale convection and mesoscale organised convection on tropical atmospheric phenomena is of particular interest.
